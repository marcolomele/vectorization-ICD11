# Semantic Vectorization of Hierarchical Medical Knowledge (ICD-11) via Large Language Models

A comprehensive approach to enriching and vectorizing the World Health Organization's ICD-11 medical classification system using advanced biomedical language models and embedding techniques.

## üè• Overview

The 11th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) serves as the global diagnostic standard, organizing over 40,000 medical entities within a complex hierarchical structure. However, **ICD-11 descriptions suffer from significant information gaps** - with 7,066 entries having empty descriptions and an average completeness score of only 14% - severely hindering computational applications like semantic search and automated coding.

### Key Research Challenge
*How can we systematically enrich sparse ICD-11 descriptions and create high-quality vector representations for biomedical applications?*

**Our Solution**: Leverage Llama3-OpenBioLLM-70B to generate comprehensive medical descriptions, then evaluate multiple embedding approaches to create the first open-source vectorization of ICD-11's complex hierarchical structure.

## üìä Dataset & Enrichment

- **13,960 ICD-11 entities** comprising 10,678 diseases (76%) and 3,282 classification entities (24%)
- **Original limitations**: 154-character average description length, 7,066 empty descriptions, 14% completeness score
- **Enhanced dataset**: 800-character average descriptions, zero empty entries, 78% completeness score

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **WHO API Extraction** using breadth-first search to crawl the hierarchical structure
2. **Bayesian Imputation** for missing values while preserving medical relationships
3. **LLM Enhancement** via Llama3-OpenBioLLM-70B with structured prompts (causes, symptoms, transmission, diagnosis)
4. **Multi-axis Validation** across linguistic, medical, and hierarchical dimensions

## üß† Methodology

### Description Generation
We employ **Llama3-OpenBioLLM-70B**, chosen for its superior performance over proprietary alternatives like Med-PaLM 2 and GPT-4 on biomedical benchmarks. Our structured prompt ensures comprehensive coverage: Overview, Causes, Symptoms, Transmission, Diagnosis.

**Generation Parameters**:
- Temperature: 0.2 (deterministic reproducibility)
- Max tokens: 800 (information density)
- Structured medical format with standardized ordering

### Embedding Models Evaluation
We systematically compare **seven embedding approaches**:

#### Traditional Methods
- **TF-IDF**: 3,000 features with SVD reduction
- **FastText**: Skip-gram model, window size 5

#### Transformer-Based Models
- **BERT**: General-domain baseline (bert-base-uncased)
- **BioBERT**: PubMed abstracts fine-tuning
- **BioClinicalBERT**: MIMIC-III clinical notes specialization
- **PubMedBERT**: From-scratch biomedical training
- **GatorTron**: 82-billion token clinical corpus

### Comprehensive Evaluation Framework
Our evaluation spans multiple biomedical tasks to assess embedding quality:

1. **Intrinsic Quality**: Silhouette scores, Calinski-Harabasz indices, Davies-Bouldin scores
2. **Comorbidity Detection**: Correlation with disease co-occurrence patterns
3. **Symptom-Disease Matching**: Clinical relevance of semantic relationships
4. **Hierarchical Consistency**: Preservation of ICD-11's taxonomic structure
5. **Encyclopedia Definition Retrieval**: Accuracy in matching external medical definitions

## üîç Key Findings

### Description Enhancement Results
Our LLM-generated descriptions show marked improvements across all validation metrics:

| Metric | Original ICD-11 | Enhanced Descriptions |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Completeness Score** | 14% | 78% |
| **Average Length** | 154 characters | 800 characters |
| **Empty Descriptions** | 7,066 entries | 0 entries |
| **Medical Causality** | Baseline | 6x improvement |
| **Readability (Flesch-Kincaid)** | 8.9 (intermediate) | 12-15.5 (academic) |

### Embedding Performance Rankings

| Rank | Model | Score | Interpretation |
|------|-------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | **TF-IDF** | 0.28 | Excels at lexical overlap detection |
| 2 | **GatorTron** | 0.19 | Strong clinical context understanding |
| 3 | **PubMedBERT** | 0.17 | Balanced biomedical knowledge |

#### Symptom-Disease Matching (Clinical Relevance)
| Rank | Model | Agreement Rate | Consistency |
|------|-------|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | **PubMedBERT** | 35% inter-model | High consensus |
| 2 | **BioBERT** | 35% inter-model | Medical specialization |
| 3 | **GatorTron** | 35% inter-model | Clinical notes expertise |

#### Hierarchical Structure Preservation
| Rank | Model | 1-Symbol Accuracy | 4-Symbol Accuracy |
|------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **PubMedBERT** | 92.33% | 75.13% |
| 2 | **BioBERT** | 89.95% | 66.14% |
| 3 | **BERT** | 83.07% | 51.85% |

### Key Insights
- **Contextual models** (PubMedBERT, BioBERT, GatorTron) excel at semantic understanding and hierarchical relationships
- **Traditional methods** (TF-IDF, FastText) outperform in direct lexical matching tasks like comorbidity detection
- **Domain-specific training** provides crucial advantages - PubMedBERT's from-scratch biomedical training shows superior performance
- **Task-dependent performance** highlights the need for embedding selection based on specific biomedical applications
